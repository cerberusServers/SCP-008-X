A plugin for SCP:SL that enables server hosts to toggle classes infecting their targets on kill. This plugin requires EXILED 2.x to operate.
# Config Options

This plugin is still under development and planned to include an infection-over-time mechanic for SCP-049-2 targets, treatment system for aforementioned mechanic, and cusomtizable cassie announcements to name a few. I also plan to add whatever is in high demand from the plugin's users, so feel free to submit your ideas!
If something is not working as intended or outright broken, please submit an issue ticket and I'll look into it as soon as possible!
